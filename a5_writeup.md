# Assignment 5 Write up

Assignment 5 can be broken up into the following parts:
1. Import the Necessary Modules:
- `copy`: For creating deep copies of objects
- `Stack` and `Queue`: Custom implementations for DFS and BFS operations
2. Utility Functions: 
- `remove_if_exists`: Removes a specified element from a list if it exists, which is used to remove the possibilites from a cell
3. Board Class:
- Represents the Sudoku board
- Consists of functions that will find the most constrained cell, and update the board, which eliminates possible solutions
4. DFS & BFS Functions:
- `DFS`: Uses depth-first search to solve the Sudoku puzzle. It works by trying to fill the most constrained cell with potential values until a solution is found or backtracks if a mistake is made
- `BFS`: Uses breadth-first search to solve the Sudoku puzzle in a similar fashion to DFS but explores nodes level by level
5. Main Execution:
- Defines two different sets of initial moves for Sudoku puzzles
- Uses both DFS and BFS to solve each puzzle and prints the results


After completing the assignment, answer the following reflection questions:

## Reflection Questions

1. How do the performance and efficiency of the Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms compare when solving Sudoku puzzles? In what scenarios might one approach be preferable over the other?
Because BFS works horizontally and because BFS works with queues, BFS works more efficiently and quickly compared to DFS, which work vertically and works with stacks. DFS would work if someone would need to get a solution using the least amount of iterations possible.


2. How did the choice of data structures (like the Stack for DFS and Queue for BFS) impact the implementation and functionality of the algorithms? Are there alternative data structures or design patterns that could have been used to achieve the same objectives?
I don't understand any of this because when we started this I had to miss out for a day.


3. Considering the current implementation, how might the Sudoku solver be adapted or extended for larger puzzles or different types of grid-based logic games? How can the lessons learned from this assignment be applied to real-world problem-solving or optimization challenges?
The algorithm used for the Sudoku solver can be used to deal with other logic games such as Uno (which focuses more on color, but also numbers like Sudoku) or crossword (which focuses more on words and definitions, which with this case there would have to be dictionaries combined with the algorithm). Lessons learned from this assignment can be applied to what could be the best solution for a situation that would be otherwise difficult to take care of.
